<!-- How to snipte step by step

STEP 0. 

Find one of your peeps to do this with. Programming is always more fun in a small
group rather than by yourself and you will figure more out more easily together.

-------
STEP 1.

You MUST to install a text editor;

- For Windows open - http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/6.5/npp.6.5.Installer.exe
- For Mac open - http://ash.barebones.com/TextWrangler_4.5.3.dmg
- For Linux open a terminal window and type 'Nano' and hit enter

Follow all the instructions on the site you picked above to download and install your 
text editor which is your new besty!

-------
STEP 2. 

Go to the site with the snitpe and in your web browser menu view the source code
of the web page. 

In Google Chrome the menu is View-> Developer-> View Source
Find the snipte you want by looking for < *** Start Snipte>
Copy everything between the start and < ***** End Snipte>

to copy use your mouse to select all the lines in the snipte and then ricght click
to copy, like we said everything from below the line with three stars until the 
line with five stars. 
(right clicking on what you selected allows you to pop up the copy menu.)

-------
STEP 3. 

Open your shiny new besty text editor and open a new file if it is not already 
then paste in the snipte you copied in Step 2.

-------
STEP 4. 

"Save As" the file somewhere (like your desktop) where you will be easily able to 
find it later and give it a name, whatever you like, and end it with .html if you 
are doing a web based snipte. 
(for the snipte on CoderDojo.org save the file as pong.html)

-------
STEP 5.

Close the text editor and find the file you saved (possibly on your desktop if you
saved it there.)

-------
STEP 6. 

Double click on the file if it is a .html and you will hopefully get a fun surprise.
If it doesn't work try to figure out what is wrong. (Hint try a diiferent web browser)

Sometimes Snipte have deliberate small mistakes you need to figure out how to fix.

Sometimes you need to put together a lot of different snipte to make something 
that works.

-------
STEP 7. 

To customise the game pong on Coderderjo.org you can do a little bit, use your 
text editor to open pong.htm and delete the word YourName and replace it by 
typing in your own name instead.  

Then save pong.htm again and then run it again and see what happens.

-------
BONUS STEPS.

See what else you can change in the code and still have the game work.
You can look up what each word in the code means at http://www.w3schools.com or
http://www.codecademy.com

Keep checking in the source of www.snipte.org for hints and clues to more 
cool stuff and soon pointers to some other sites who are busy hiding more 
snipte for you just like a treasure hunt! :-)
