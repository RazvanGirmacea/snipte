If you are a professional developer and you want to assist young people to learn 
the art of coding please put snipte code on you own websites.

If you are a partenr of Snipte.org or CoderDojo and want to assist also please
put up snipte.

You can let us know you have so we can link to them. Just email us at 
info@codedojo.com 

Or you can wait for our web crawler to discover them and link them into the 
network.

If you would like to assist in making snipte.org better and more fun please email
us as well.

-Snipte Rules-

Snipte will not be registered or approved if they; 

- Are placed on websites with age inaappropriate material (Non-PG13) on them.
- Contain age inappropriate material.
- Contain malware.
- Contain data harvesting for any purpose.
- Are placed with the express purpose of selling goods and or services to children

Simply put use some common sense about where you put snipte and what you put 
in them. 

See the child protection policies of BBC and RTE for further guidence.

http://www.rte.ie/about/en/policies-and-reports/policies-guidelines/2012/0330/315576-rtes-child-protection-policy/

Always mark the start and end of each snipte comment with; 

< *** start snipte > 

< ***** end snipte > 


You can see an example in the source of www.coderdojo.org

Please please comment your snipte code as verbosely as you can so that anyone can
figure out what each line of code does. Make it super obvious.

Please also include a minified version of the code in a seperate snipte so that its
easy to cut and paste as many first time users have trouble with cut and paste until
they get the hang of it.

You do not have to stick to web langauges you can leave snipte of any kind of code
and please leave instructions that any young person can follow to implement 
wherever possible.

Remember to put in enough comment tags so that the snipte never become visible or 
interfere with a sites workign code.

Javascript minigames are always appreciated and feel free to put some little errors
in the code for kids to figure out. 

Snipte (pronounced sniptee like nifty) is both singular and plural so 1 snipte or 
30 snipte its all the same. As snipte is a partial acronym it cannot be used in 
scrabble.
