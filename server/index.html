Props to you!!! for reading source code!

Code is like magic and www.snipte.org is a source of source code for you.

We've been busy hidin eggs allover that you will soon discover.

VVV Scrolll right down 4 more. VVV

The code we hide is bits of script, little easter eggs we calls snipte.

Fallow links, find hints and look for sneaky stars on sites like...

< *** Start Snipte >
< ***** End Snipte >

Cut and paste snipte and make cool stuff.

Check source on www.CoderDojo.org and find the first game!

There's lots o stuff that makes a site read the blow by blow below;
-->

<!-- Ahem, Lines like this, that start with "lessThan EclamationMark minus minus" are comments.>

<!--
Larger comment blocks, like this, have the comment marks above an below them.

Text with such marks are called comments becuase they are written by developers
and programmers to illustrate and illuminate what something in the Source Code
does or to remeber something or just to let other programmers know what they
were thinking when they wrote something.

Well commented code is much more fun to work on especially if it is shared with
others as they can more easily grasp the point of what was being written.

There are a lot more comments than usual in the code for for this Snipte web site.

The very first line is also a comment and its some gubbins about what kind of
web page this is.

You can write almost anything in a comment and it will only be seen if people
view the source code of the web page or site.

The actual code that makes the snitpe.org site run is very simple and you can
see it all below and we put in LOTS of comments.

you can open tags within tags.

As you can see above there is not a lot of code needed to make a basic web page.
